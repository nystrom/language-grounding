  Authoritative grounding in real TypeScript (5.x–7.0) semantics for coding
  agents: structural typing, the type-vs-value world, control-flow narrowing,
  generics and conditional/mapped/template-literal types, the toolchain (tsc,

# TypeScript grounding

Ground yourself in what the TypeScript checker actually proves — and in which
version — before editing or explaining TypeScript. Types are **erased** before
execution: they constrain the compiler, not the runtime. A construct that
type-checks can still throw, and TypeScript's type system is deliberately unsound
in specific, known places. Read the reference that matches your question:

| Question | Read |
|----------|------|
| What does this mean to the checker? (structural typing, type vs value space, narrowing, declaration merging, assignability, `this`, erasure) | `references/semantics.md` |
| Generics, variance, conditional types, `infer`, mapped types, template literal types, key utility types | `references/types.md` |
| Footguns: `any` vs `unknown`, excess-property checks, enum quirks, `as`/`as const`, `{}` and `object`, array covariance, `this` typing, `NaN` | `references/sharp-edges.md` |
| What changed across 5.x, 6.0, and the 7.0 native port; removed options; migration | `references/versions.md` |
| tsc, the Go-native `tsgo`, key `tsconfig` options, `typescript-eslint`, project references | `references/toolchain.md` |

## What an agent must not infer

Do not assume TypeScript behaves like Java, C#, or Flow, and do not assume types
exist at runtime — there is no reflection over erased types, and `instanceof`
works on values, not interfaces. Do not assume a compiler option or syntax valid
in one version is valid in another: 6.0 removed a batch of legacy options and 7.0
deleted them. Each reference has a "What an agent may/must not infer" section —
consult it rather than pattern-matching across languages or versions.
